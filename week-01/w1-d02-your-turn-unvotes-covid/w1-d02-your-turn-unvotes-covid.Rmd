## AE 01 - First dataviz

You have two options for this exercise:

- Option 1: Voting patterns of countries in the UN General Assembly

- Option 2: COVID-19 fatality numbers across the globe

Pick one and complete it. Optionally, try the other one as well.

**Option 1.**

- Go to [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) and start `AE 01a - First dataviz - UN Votes`.
- In the Files pane (bottom right corner), spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. 
- Open it and click "Knit".
- Then...
  - Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
  - Change the country names to those you're interested in. Spelling and capitalization must match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling. 
  - Knit again. Voila, your first data visualization!
